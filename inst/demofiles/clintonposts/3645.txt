<div>There were 39 combat related deaths in Iraq during the month of      January, 2004.....In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders      in the month of January.      That's just one American city, about as deadly      as the entire war torn country of Iraq.      When some claim President Bush shouldn't have      started this war, they might reflect on  the following:      FDR:      led us into World War II.  Germany never attacked us:      Japan did.  From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost,  an average of      112,500 per year.      Truman:      finished that war and started one in Korea.      North Korea never attacked us.  From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were      lost,      an average of 18,334 per year.      John F. Kennedy:      Committed the U.S. to war in the Vietnam      conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us.      Johnson:      turned Vietnam into a quagmire.  From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were      lost, an average of 5,800 per year.      Clinton:      went to war in Bosnia without UN or French      consent, even though Bosnia never attacked us. He was offered Osama      bin      Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and      did nothing.  Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.      In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has:      liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban crippled al-Qaida, put      nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and      North Korea without firing a shot in those countries, and captured a      terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people, lost fewer than      1,000 soldiers in the entire Iraq conflict, about 1/3 of the number      of people lost in less than      2 hours in the attack and subsequent collapse of the World Trade      Center Buildings.                                 The Democrats complain about how long the      war is taking, but:      It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the      Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation.      We've been looking for evidence of chemical      weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find      the      Rose Law Firm billing records.      It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to      destroy the Medina Republican Guard      than it took Ted Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank      at Chappaquiddick.      It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in      Florida!!!!      Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB!      The Military morale is high!  The biased media hopes we are too      ignorant to      recognize the facts.       PASS IT ON
